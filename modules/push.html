<h1>AeroGear Push Module</h1>

<p><big>Send push notifications to any device, regardless of platform or network.</big></p>

<p>The push module consists of the AeroGear Unified Push Server which sends native messages to different mobile devices.</p>

<p>In addition to the Unified Push Server there are two additional backend modules: SimplePush Server that uses WebSockets, intended for WebOS, but due to its light weight would also work for small devices like Internet of Things applications. </p>

<p>There is also work underway to implement a server based on the HTTP2 WebPush specification, which will likely be the successor of SimplePush service in the future.</p>
