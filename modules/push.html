<h2>UnifiedPush Server</h2>

<p>The AeroGear UnifiedPush Server sends native push messages to different mobile operating systems, such as Android, iOS, Windows
  or Firefox OS/SimplePush.</p>

<h2>SimplePush Server</h2>

<p>Our SimplePush Server represents an implementation of Mozilla's SimplePush, which is based on top of WebSocket. It was created
  for Push Notifications delivery on FirefoxOS, but it can also be used for different use cases, like Internet-of-Things
  applications.</p>

<h2>WebPush Server</h2>

<p>The
  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomson-webpush-http2">WebPush Specification</a> is based on HTTP2 and is currently in an early state. The AeroGear team sees it as the successor
  of SimplePush.</p>
